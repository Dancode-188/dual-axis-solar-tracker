## üß™ Quick Testing Guide

### Test 1: Watch Initialization (30 seconds)
**What to do:**
- Just click Play and watch
- Open Serial Monitor

**What you'll see:**
- Serial: "=== SOLAR TRACKER INITIALIZING ==="
- LCD: "Solar Tracker" ‚Üí "Initializing..." ‚Üí "System READY"
- Servo moves to 90¬∞
- Serial shows sensor readings

**Success:** System initializes without errors ‚úÖ

### Test 2: Simulate East Tracking (1 minute)
**What to do:**
1. Find the 4 photoresistor (LDR) components
2. Click on **top-left LDR** (North-East)
3. Adjust slider to **800 lux**
4. Click on **bottom-left LDR** (South-East)  
5. Adjust to **800 lux**
6. Watch what happens!

**What you'll see:**
- Serial: "Errors: EW=300 NS=0"
- Serial: "Adjusting azimuth: Turn EAST"
- **Servo rotates clockwise** (turning east!)
- LCD updates: "Az:95"

**Success:** Panel turns toward brighter east side ‚úÖ

---

### Test 3: Simulate High Temperature Stow (1 minute)
**What to do:**
1. Find the **DHT22** sensor (temperature)
2. Click on it
3. Change temperature to **55¬∞C**
4. Wait 5 seconds

**What you'll see:**
- Serial: "!!! HIGH TEMPERATURE - STOWING !!!"
- **Servo moves to 0¬∞**
- **Stepper moves to 0¬∞**
- LCD: "STOW MODE - HIGH TEMP!"
- **Yellow LED** turns ON

**Success:** Weather protection activates ‚úÖ

---

### Test 4: Manual Control (2 minutes)
**What to do:**
1. Click the **blue "MANUAL" button**
2. Open Serial Monitor
3. Type in Serial input box:
   - Type **`W`** and press Send ‚Üí Servo +10¬∞
   - Type **`A`** and press Send ‚Üí Stepper +10¬∞
   - Type **`H`** and press Send ‚Üí Return home

**What you'll see:**
- LCD changes to "MANUAL CTRL"
- Motors respond to commands
- Position updates on LCD

**Success:** Manual control working ‚úÖ

---

### Test 5: Night Mode (30 seconds)
**What to do:**
1. Adjust **all 4 LDRs** to **50 lux** (very dark)
2. Watch response

**What you'll see:**
- Serial: "Too dark - moving to STOW"
- System enters STOW mode
- LCD: "Night mode"

**Success:** Night detection working ‚úÖ

## üì∏ What to Screenshot for Your Report

Take screenshots of:

1. **Circuit Overview** - Full Wokwi workspace showing all components
2. **LCD During Tracking** - Showing "TRACKING" and position (Az:XX El:XX)
3. **Serial Monitor Output** - Showing LDR readings and decisions
4. **Temperature Stow** - LCD showing "STOW MODE - HIGH TEMP!"
5. **Manual Mode** - LCD showing "MANUAL CTRL"
6. **Motors** - Close-up of servo/stepper in different positions

These screenshots will go in your Q7 documentation!

## üéì For Your Professor

**If your professor wants to test it:**

1. Share the Wokwi project link (from Option 2 above)
2. They can click and instantly run your simulation
3. No installation needed
4. Works on any device with a browser

**This is a BIG advantage over Proteus files!**

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Serial Monitor is Essential:**
   - Always have it open during testing
   - Shows exactly what the system is thinking
   - Great for debugging

2. **Component Interaction:**
   - Click components to adjust values
   - Sliders for gradual changes
   - Text input for precise values

3. **Simulation Speed:**
   - Can be slowed down with speed controls
   - Useful for observing state transitions
   - Normal speed = 1√ó (real-time)

4. **Saving Your Work:**
   - Wokwi auto-saves as you edit
   - Can create account to keep projects
   - Or just keep local files and recreate when needed

5. **Performance:**
   - Works best in Chrome or Edge
   - Close other browser tabs if slow
   - Desktop/laptop recommended (works on mobile too)

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

**Problem:** "Library not found" error
**Solution:** Make sure you added BOTH libraries via Library Manager

**Problem:** Circuit looks messy
**Solution:** That's OK! It's the functionality that matters, not appearance

**Problem:** Serial Monitor doesn't show anything
**Solution:** 
- Make sure simulation is running (Play button)
- Baud rate should auto-detect (115200)
- Try stopping and restarting

**Problem:** Motors don't move
**Solution:** Check that diagram.json loaded correctly - all components should be visible
